  <strong><u>Chapter1</u></strong>
  <br>
    <p>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
    Now the earth was formless and empty,
    darkness was over the surface of the deep,
    and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
    And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
    God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
    God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night."
    And there was evening, and there was morning--the first day.</p>
    <p>And God said,
    "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water."
    So God made the expanse and separated the water
    under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.
    God called the expanse "sky."
    And there was evening, and there was morning--the second day.
    And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place,
    and let dry ground appear." And it was so.
    God called the dry ground "land,"
    and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.</p>
    <p>Then God said,
    "Let the land produce vegetation:
    seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it,
    according to their various kinds." And it was so.
    The land produced vegetation:
    plants bearing seed according to their kinds
    and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds.
    And God saw that it was good.
    And there was evening, and there was morning--the third day.
    And God said,
    "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day
    from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years,
    and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth."
    And it was so.</p>
